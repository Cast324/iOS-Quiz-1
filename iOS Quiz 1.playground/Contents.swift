//: ### Question 2
//: What are the 4 layers of the iOS operating system? **(use a block comment this time)**


//: ### Question 3
//: Declare a constant that is **implicitly** typed or **inferred** named `pi` and assign it the value: `M_PI`


//: ### Question 4
//: Declare a variable that is **explicitly** typed as a `Int` named `myInt`, but don't assign it a value yet


//: ### Question 5
//: Assign the value of `pi` from question 1 to the variable `myInt` from question 2 **(hint: you have to convert...)**


//: ### Question 6
//: Print out a string that tells us what the value of `myInt` is using **string interpolation**


//: ### Question 7
//: Declare a variable that is an **Optional** `UIView` named `myView` and assign it the value `nil`


//: ### Question 8
//: Using the `myView` variable from Question 6, demonstrate using `if-let` **optional binding** to unwrap the value and assign it to a non-Optional variable


//: ### Question 9
//: Using the `myView` variable from Question 6, demonstrate using the `!` operator to **force unwrap** it and assign it to a non-Optional variable


//: ### Question 10
//: Why is `if-let` preferable to `!` in most cases?


//: ### Bonus Question
//: Declare an **implicitly unwrapped Optional** variable named `unwrappedView` and assign it the value of `myView` from above
